# CV_OUT
USB (MIDI) to CV DIY device for monome norns

-----------------------------------------

I have developed a DIY device that can be connected to a NORNS via USB and send an receive CV signals. It is based on an Arduion MICRO. Everything is exxplained an layed out in the "CIVO_Layout_DAC.pdf". You'll need a C library called "AH_MCP4922" made by A. Hinkel. 
It is necessary for the communication with the mcp4022 DAC chip. You can download it from here: http://www.alhin.de/arduino. But I included a copy in this git, since the website seems not online anymore.


Unfortunately I became very ill and connot continue this project. So everything here is as it is. I hope it is usefu√∂ for some people.

Cheers!
